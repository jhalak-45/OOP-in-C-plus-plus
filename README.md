## 1. Basics
This folder contains introductory C++ programs that focus on the fundamental concepts of the language, such as:
- Variables
- Data types
- Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Basic I/O operations

## 2. Exception Handling
This section covers programs that demonstrate how to handle exceptions in C++ using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` statements. It includes:
- Handling runtime errors
- Custom exceptions
- Stack unwinding

## 3. File Handling
In this folder, you'll find programs that handle file operations such as reading from and writing to files using C++ file streams (`fstream`):
- Reading from a file
- Writing to a file
- Appending to a file
- File pointers and file status

## 4. Function Template and Template Specialization
Programs in this section demonstrate the use of function templates and template specialization in C++. These are useful for writing generic code:
- Function templates for basic operations
- Specialized templates for custom data types

## 5. Functions
This folder focuses on different types of functions in C++:
- Inline functions
- Friend functions
- Function overloading
- Recursion
- Lambda expressions

## 6. Inheritance
This folder contains programs that demonstrate object-oriented concepts, particularly inheritance:
- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Virtual functions and polymorphism

## 7. Lab Exam Questions
This section includes commonly asked questions in lab exams. They test your knowledge of various C++ concepts like:
- Object-oriented programming
- Functions and templates
- Exception handling

## 8. Operator Overloading
These programs show how to overload operators in C++ to extend their functionality for user-defined types:
- Overloading arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.)
- Overloading relational operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.)
- Overloading insertion (`<<`) and extraction (`>>`) operators

## 9. Type Conversion
This folder contains programs that demonstrate how to perform type conversion between basic types and user-defined types in C++:
- Basic to class type conversion
- Class to basic type conversion
- Class-to-class type conversion

## 10. Other Programs

- `dynamicConstructor.cpp`: Demonstrates dynamic constructors in C++, which allocate memory dynamically during object creation.
- `friendFunction.cpp`: A program that shows how to implement and use friend functions in C++.
- `sumOfnNumberUsingArray.cpp`: This program sums `n` numbers using an array and demonstrates basic array operations in C++.
